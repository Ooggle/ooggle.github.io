                <p>Hello, i'm a French student, developper and cyber-security enthusiast who love to learn new things.</p>
                <p>I made a lot of development projects especially with PHP in the past.<br>
                Now I am more into low level languages like C or assembly.</p>
                <p>I also like to learn some new stuff, I recently started kernel development which is really interesting and SDL2 to make some 2D multiplatform graphic apps.</p>

                <h4>Ricing Linux</h4>
                <p>As I use Linux as my primary operating system, I went through the fundamental question: witch distribution use?</p>
                <p>From this, I have started customize my new fresh Debian install by installing from scratch the X Server, Window Manager, notifications deamon et cetera. Dealing with config files and stuff like that.</p>
                <p>Today, I still improve my skills in this domain and that's partly what made me decide to write my own kernel.</p>

                <h4>CTFs</h4>
                <p>Since i hear about what is cyber-security (fight with black hats to protect high important etc...), I thought it was super cool and so I made my mind starting to do CTFs</p>
                <p>Those are pretty fun games where you need to break a system or get around some security to get the beloved flag.<br>
                Root Me is a famous French website who do those kind of things.</p>

                <h4>Video Games</h4>
                <p>I sometimes manage to play games. I love to play at some rythm games like Osu! or StepMania.</p>
                <p>Recently, one of my friends initiated me to the Final fantasy serie so I started playing at FF9 which is a very cool game!</p>
